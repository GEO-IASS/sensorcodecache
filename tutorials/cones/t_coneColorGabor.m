% Script outline:
%     1. Build scene as a color-opponent Gabor patch with Horwitz Lab
%         display and imageHarmonicColor). 
%     2. Build oi and sensor with specified properties from paper (pupil
%         width, macular density, eccentricity, etc.).
%     3. Create a dynamic scene by altering the Gabor phase and
%         regenerating the scene and recomputing the oi and sensor.
%     4. Build the outer segment object with linear filters and compute its
%         response with the dynamic sensor structure.
%     5. Compute the response across each cone type.  For each noise
%         iteration (a) project the time series of each cone onto the
%         expected mean time series, (b) take that mean value for each cone
%         type to give the mean on that particular noise iteration. The
%         projection step eliminates signals that are orthogonal to the
%         expected linear temporal response.  The expected response is
%         derived by running the simulation with the noise flag set to 0
%         (photon noise only). This calculation produces an (L, M, S)
%         triplet for each noise iteration.  This is a specific
%         implementation of an ideal observer; see the paper for details.
%     6. This process is first done for zero contrast with no Gabor
%         present, and repeated for a range of contrasts specified in the
%         contrastArr variable. The pooled response for the cone array at
%         each contrast level is compared to the pooled response for no
%         Gabor present using a linear SVM, and the cross-validated
%         accuracy of the linear SVM is calculated.
